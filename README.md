# Automatic Moodle Downloader

The `moodleCrawler.py` script downloads all the files posted in the course page of all the courses you are enroled to.
Duplicated Files in the `root_dir` get deleted. Links in the history file get not downloaded.

You can change names of downloaded Files and Places them to a different location, they will not be downloaded again (only if you delete the history files).

Set the following in the file `config.ini` before running the script

- `username` [String] : Moodle Username
- `password` [String] : Moodle Password
- `root_dir` [String] : The path to the directory where the files are to be stored
- `authurl` [String] : URL for moodle authentication. Mostly ends with '/login/index.php'
- `baseurl` [String] : URL of moodle installation. Could be something like 'https://moodle.someMoodle.de' or 'https://someMoodle.de/moodle/'
- `useauthstate` [Boolean] : If AuthState should be used for login. This needs to be set to true if in the authentication URL the parameter AuthState is set. Try to set this to `true` if the login fails! 
- `reloginonfile` [Boolean] : If the crawler should check if it is still logged in, if not it relogin. This is normally not necessary
- `allcourses` [Boolean] : If all courses should be crawled or only the courses listed on the dashboard
- `forum` [Boolean] : If forums should also be crawled 
- `wiki` [Boolean] : If wikis should also be crawled 
- `history` [Boolean] : If a history file should be used 
- `maxdepth` [Integer] : The depth how deep the crawler should maximal crawl (default = 9) 
- `loglevel` [Integer] : Sets the level of logging (0 - less information / 5 - all information)
- `externallinks` [Boolean] : If external links should get crawled
- `findduplicates` [Boolean] : If files in course folders should be checked for duplicates (duplicates get not deleted)
- `findallduplicates` [Boolean] : If files in different courses should be checked for duplicates (duplicates get not deleted)
- `deleteduplicates` [Boolean] : If duplicates should be deleted. (works only if findduplicates and/or findallduplicates is set to true) 
- `informationaboutduplicates` [Boolean] : If a information file should be created in a folder with duplicates. The file inform about the duplicates. (works only if findduplicates and/or findallduplicates is set)
- `downloadcoursepages` [Boolean] : If the course main page should be downloaded
- `crawlcourseslink` [String] : Moodle Course Crawler startpoint (Default course/index.php = all Courses). This is not necessary for the Moodle Crawler Script
- `dontcrawl` [List] : A list of file extensions, that should not be crawled
- `colors` [Boolean] : If colors should be used (For Windows use Cmder to display colors correct. http://cmder.net/)
- `notifications` [Boolean] : If you want to get notified if new files were found
- `onlycrawlcourses` [List] : A list of course IDs, that should only be crawled. It creates a subset of courses that were found in the dashboard (option `allcourses` creates the superset). If the list is empty no courses will be ignored.
- `dontcrawlcourses` [List] : A list of course IDs, that should not be crawled. It creates a subset of courses that were found in the dashboard (option `allcourses` has higher priority). If the list is empty no courses will be ignored.
- `antirecursion` [Boolean] : This prevent recursive crawling of the same page. If you do missing files try to set this to `false`

All the files are stored in their respective directories inside the `root_dir` with the names as in moodle.

The crawler finds only coourses in your course list. So make sure that you check your settings of your course list on `https://whateverYourMoodleAdress/my` , so that every of your courses gets displayed there.

It is planed to build a script to login (and logout) from all courses on a moodle platform. For the moment there is a script called `moodleCourseCrawler.py` that uses the `crawlcourseslink` option. This script only logs all courses on the platform.
